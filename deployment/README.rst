Deployment
----------

Each project that has medium complexity should have a clear deployment process
in order to allow launch a new release in a reliable and quick way.
With a correct deployment process you can detect bugs before introducing it to a
production environment.


Version Control System
======================

Every project must use a Version control systems (VCS). VCS are useful to track
the changes we made in our code and facilitates team collaboration.
`Git <https://git-scm.com>`_ is our preferred VCS.
We use `GitHub <https://github.com>`_ for open-source projects and
`GitLab <https://gitlab.com>`_ for proprietary projects.


Versioning
==========

Has a correct versioning system is important to has tracked the impact of a new
deploy. We suggest use `SemVer 2.0 <http://semver.org/>`_ , so given a version
number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

* MAJOR version when incompatible API changes are introduced,
* MINOR version when functionality in a backwards-compatible manner are introduced and
* PATCH version when backwards-compatible bug fixes are introduced


Continuous integration
======================

A `continuous integration service <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration>`_
eases the development workflow by automating tasks such as testing and
deployment.

There are many CI tools, we suggest use
`GitLab CI <https://about.gitlab.com/features/gitlab-ci-cd/>`_ or
`Jenkins <https://jenkins.io>`_.
