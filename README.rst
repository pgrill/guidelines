========

These are the guidelines that lead us to create beautiful software.
Please contribute to it following this `contribution guidelines <./CONTRIBUTING>`__.

A note on the language:

- "Don't/Use" are mandatory instructions.
- "Avoid/Prefer" indicates worst/better options so you may violate them only with a good reason.

A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.
