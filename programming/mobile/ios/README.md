## Code Style

### Human Interface Guidelines

If you are new to mobile development or to iOS itself, take some time to take a look at the
[Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/)
by Apple. This is how Apple encourages both designers and developers to build their apps. Sticking
to the Human Interface Guidelines (commonly referenced as *HIG*) is not optional for us, since it
comes a lot of benefits for both the development team and the users. Those guidelines also provide
a really good overview of native UI components and capabilities such as 3D Touch, Face/Touch ID or Wallet.

### Project Structure

In order to keep all your source code in order, you may want to follow some folder structure
depending on your architecture. For instance, you can use the following:

```text
├── Project
│   ├── AppDelegate.swift
│   ├── Assets.xcassets
│   ├── Colors.swift
│   ├── Constants.swift
│   ├── Models
│   │   ├── Model1.swift
│   │   ├── Model2.swift
│   │   ├── Model3.swift
│   │   └── ModelN.swift
│   ├── Modules
│   │   ├── External Services
│   │   ├── Project
│   │   └── Helpers
│   ├── Networking
│   │   ├── APIConstants.swift
│   │   ├── Services
│   │   │   ├── Service1.swift
│   │   │   ├── Service2.swift
│   │   │   ├── Service3.swift
│   │   │   └── ServiceN.swift
│   │   └── Utils.swift
│   ├── Persistence
│   ├── Resources
│   ├── Info.plist
│   └── User Interface
│       ├── Feature1
│       ├── Feature2
│       ├── Feature3
│       └── FeatureN
├── Project.xcodeproj
├── Project.xcworkspace
├── ProjectTests
├── ProjectUITests
├── Bridging-Header.h
├── Podfile
├── Podfile.lock
├── Pods
├── README.md
├── env.secrets
└── scripts
```

## IDEs

### Xcode

[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is the IDE of choice for iOS and macOS, and the only one
officially supported by Apple. You’re encouraged but not restricted to use it, and you can use some
alternatives such as Jetbrains’ [AppCode](https://www.jetbrains.com/objc/).  In order to install
Xcode, simply download Xcode on the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835).

## Project Setup

There is a common controversy regarding whether to write the UI in pure code or use storyboards to
build it in a more graphical way (drag-and-drop). Both are know to work well depending on the use
case and the project size.

There are some considerations to take in account if you use Storyboards:

- Storyboards are more prone to have merge conflicts since they use an internal auto-generated XML structure.
- It’s way easier to structure and reuse views in code, easily avoiding repeated code.
- Using storyboards can cause coupling between your code and the UI, which can lead to crashes (e.g
  when an outlet or action is not set up correctly). _These issues are not detected by the compiler_.

Even though using code has it’s advantages, Storyboards can be helpful if you’re new to the
ecosystem or want to rapidly layout an interface for an MVP or PoC. Also, iteration is often faster
since you can preview most UI changes without rebuilding your project. For size classes (similar to
responsive design if you come from the web ecosystem), Interface Builder gives you a live preview of
how your interface looks like in all device sizes.

### Using storyboards and code for UI at the same time

You can get the best of both worlds by simply using an hybrid approach. Start sketching the initial
design with Storyboards (you can also invite designers to work with you in that step). Then, when
you need more reliability on the UI, you may progressively transition to a code-based setup that is
easier to maintain.

## Ignores

If you’re using Swift, you need to make _git_ to ignore some files that should not be versioned.
Please use [this .gitignore file](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Swift.gitignore)
provided by GitHub. (An [Objective-C version is also available](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Objective-C.gitignore))

## Dependency Management

We usually use **Cocoapods** for dependency management. In order to install it you’ll need to do:

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

And create a `Podfile` in your project with

```bash
pod init
```

Then, run a `pod install` , that will create an `.xcworkspace` file that you’ll need to use instead
of the `.xcproject` you had used before. If you keep using the project file, Xcode won’t find the
external dependencies as they are kept in the `Pods` project inside the workspace.

## Minimum iOS version requirement

Unless specified by the client or specific OS-level feature requirements, use the second most-used
iOS version. That information can be found at the
[Apple App Store Info Page](https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/).

## Minimum Swift version requirement

Please use Swift 4 or higher.

## Data Serialization

In case you’re using Swift 4 or higher as recommended before, you can make use of the `Codable`
protocol, which gives you seamless JSON/XML/YAML serialization and deserialization without external
libraries. For more info take a look at [this Apple-provided documentation][tapd].

[tapd]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/archives_and_serialization/encoding_and_decoding_custom_types

In case you’re not using it, please use [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON)
(information about using it along _Alamofire_ can be found
[here](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON#work-with-alamofire)).

## Linting

- [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint).

## Local database

If you want to store data as fast as possible while keeping reliability on that, use
[Realm](https://realm.io/). In case you’re experimented with Core Data, we’d suggest you to use it
instead.

## Analytics and Crash Reports

For Analytics we use [Fabric](https://fabric.io) and for crash analytics we use
[Sentry](https://sentry.com/). Both have excellent guides about how to implement their SDKs into
your project’s app.

## Testing

We encourage you to write tests using [Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick) for building test
suites and [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble) for assertions instead of the stock Xcode test
tool.

## Continuous Integration

We encourage to use [BuddyBuild](https://www.buddybuild.com/) to run the CI. Although if you don't
have tests, using a CI can avoid merging unbuildable code to `master`.

## Resources

- Common Libraries
  - For networking, use [AlamoFire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire).
  - For date formatting, use [DateTools](https://github.com/MatthewYork/DateTools).
  - If you choose to write UI code, do it using [SnapKit](https://github.com/SnapKit/).
