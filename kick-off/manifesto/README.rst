Project's Manifesto
-------------------

TBD: Write project manifesto introduction

What should I put in my project's manifesto?
============================================
Your project's manifesto should include all necessary instructions in order to
set up the project, run it, run tests, etc. It's targeted mostly to newcomers
so they can start working without inconvenience.

How to implement a manifesto in my project?
===========================================

Just download the `README.md <./README.md>`__ file and adapt it to your project.
