## Wireframes

It is crucial to put the design of the application ahead of the development.
Focus should be placed on wireframing usability, user experience, and flows.
We find it important to keep the design and development cycle adequately tight,
since as we approach certain areas of the product, we often decide to cut or
change features. Those changes are an expected part of the iterative process
and feedback loop between the client, the sophilabs team, and users.
The designer will refine the sketches into HTML and CSS wireframes.
HTML and CSS wireframes are built on [moqups](https://moqups.com/). It also
allows developers to start implementing features within the wireframes.

## User Experience

In the context of our software, the user interface is the individual view that
allows for goal completion.

We evaluate interfaces on the following criteria:

* Puts outcomes first
* Provides users with affordances
* Congruent with surrounding platform
* Consistent across entire application

We put the user's goals first. No one is using our software solely because it
looks nice. There's a reason they sought out our solution. Our number one
priority is making that outcome desirable and easily attainable. We make
software easy to understand. It's not enough to be functional, users must know
capabilities exist and be able to anticipate how the software is going to react
to their inputs. Our software should be as intuitive as possible. We remain
consistent with platform guidelines. Interfaces look and feel best when they
are congruent within their context, rather than being strictly branded across
all platforms. We prefer common patterns when designing, and we maintain
consistency. Usable interfaces work as expected across the entire application.

## Interaction Design

Interaction gives users the ability to change the canvas, and to directly
manipulate it. Designing those interactions is what makes our software come to
life. Interactions should provide affordance â€” [animation],
for examples, can be used as a powerful metaphor to help a user understand an
interface. Interactions help guide a user from the beginning of a task all the
way through it's completion.

Designers guide these interactions from prototype to implementation.
For web applications we start in the browser. For review, we use gifs to
demonstrate interactions.

## Visual Design

We refer to an application's visual design exclusively as its style. We use the
[universal design principles] to communicate and bring order to those ideas in
our applications.

Those fundamentals include, among others:

* Alignment (often achieved with grids)
* Emphasis (often achieved with size, position and color)
* Consistency (buttons, links, headers typically look* alike)
* Whitespace (elegant, timeless, gives eye a rest)

Successful visual designs typically don't draw attention to themselves. The
content will be front-and-center. The workflows throughout the site will be
obvious. Resist the temptation to aim for a design that is "memorable" or a
design that "pops."

Successful designs are usable
